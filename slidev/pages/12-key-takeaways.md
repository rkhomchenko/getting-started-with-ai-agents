# Key Takeaways

<v-clicks>

- 🤖 **AI Agents** = LLM + Memory + Tools
  - More than just chat - they can take actions

- 🔄 **Agentic Loop** enables iterative problem-solving
  - Agents reason, act, evaluate, repeat

- 🧩 **Modularity** allows flexible architectures
  - Swap components as needed

- 🚀 **Choose wisely:** Reasoning models for complex tasks, standard LLMs for simple ones
  - Balance cost, latency, and accuracy
