### Intelligence Models
**GPT-4.1 (the workhorses)**

Fast, cost-efficient, knows a lot

**Use cases:**
- Summarize documents or extract data
- Answer questions about your codebase
- Generate content from templates

### Reasoning Models
**o4-mini (the strategists)**

Chain-of-thought, makes decisions, accurate

**Use cases:**
- Debug complex multi-step problems
- Plan architecture or workflow sequences
- Make strategic decisions with trade-offs

<!--
Here I would like to break down the difference between two types of models: Intelligence and Reasoning.

CLICK.

Let's start with Intelligence models, such as GPT-4.1, which are very fast and cost-efficient. They "know a lot" and can quickly answer questions, especially if those questions relate to provided data. This makes them ideal for executing specific tasks where a quick response is needed.
Typically, Intelligence models have a large context window, allowing them to work with large volumes of data, which ultimately makes them Intelligent.

On the other hand, there are Reasoning models.
They play a very important role because they allow the agent to actually think before giving an answer and make informed decisions based on information and analysis of that information. Reasoning is what enables the agent to plan complex actions, for example: "I need to first find relevant data, and then analyze it."
Unlike Intelligence models, Reasoning models have a smaller context window, but through analysis they can extract more precise data needed for decision-making or response generation.

I've added a short link so you can compare the models.

Let's move on to the next slide.
